The baseline model is based on https://github.com/chrischute/squad.git

For milestone, the baseline model is trained and evaluated.

Simple Recurrent Unit is used to accelerate the training process as well as improve the performance.

For the final project:

L1 regularization is used.

Fully connected layer is added before output layer.

Ensemble all the models.
